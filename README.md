# batch-deployment-motherduck-modal

Simple demo on deploying an ML model using Hugginface for models, Motherduck as a database and Modal for compute.

Possible next step ideas:

1. Change the code to run on a schedule (i.e.: every 10 minutes)
2. Change the database to pushshift (reddit)? Stackoverflow?
3. Use discord/telegram data
